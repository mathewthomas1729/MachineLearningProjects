Project Synopsis:  https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview
I created two models for this project. 
  1. The first model is a simple baseline model using bag of words and vectorization
  2. The second model I used GloVe word embeddings along with LSTM to classify the tweets as indicative natural disaster or not.
