This is a project to predict housing prices in Ames Iowa. The dataset was publicaly available as part of a research project and more details can be found here. The goal of this project is to build a Linear Regression model to predict housing prices based on available features. First we would need to identify which are the relevent features and then also do some feature engineering if possible to create new features from existing ones.
