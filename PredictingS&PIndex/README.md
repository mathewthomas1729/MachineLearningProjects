The goal of this project is to predict S&P 500 Index based on historical data. The idea is to create new indicators based on given data that does not induct future knowledge into our model.Because the stock price of each day can affect the volumes traded and price of the next significantly it is important to use rolling averages like a 5 day, 30 day and 1 year rolling average of closing price.
